# GifTastic

I created an array of food items and created buttons for each item to my HTML page.

When a button is clicked, the page grabs 10 animated gifs from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.

When a gif is click, it will switch to a still image.

When the gif is clicked again, it will switch back to the animated gif.

User can enter new food items through the input field. The newly added items will create new buttons to the page and perform the same functions as above.

Above each gif, the rating is displayed.
